# UFO
Module 11

**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis is to build an interactive website that will parse data based on UFO sightings. To do this we used JavaScript to create an app file that filters though the data file. We then used this create our webpage in the html file. The result is an interactive webpage that can search our data based on date, city, state, country, and shape. 

**Results**

Users can access and filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape. 
In this example we searched for any date, in Cleveland Ohio. Our table displayed a single result from our data collection.

Users can access the entire data collection by leaving the search criteria blank.

**Summary**

The drawback to this design is that the search is sensitive. For example, if you capitalize the city, or use United States instead of us; no information is displayed. So, if you are unfamiliar with the data file, and how it is formatted, you won’t know if the information doesn’t exist or if the information was inserted wrong. One recommendation I have is to create a drop-down box for the country, and shape that displays all options. This can help guide users to choosing the correct input. My second recommendation is to have the table display all data as a default, then users can search. This allows users to see the formatting, which will help better their search.
